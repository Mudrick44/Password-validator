# Password-validator and Generator
## Features

1. **Password Validation:**
   - The application evaluates the strength of user-provided passwords using a scoring system. It assesses various factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to assign a score indicating the strength of the password.
   - Password strength is categorized into levels (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong) based on the score, providing users with clear feedback on the security of their passwords.
   - The validation process includes checks for common patterns, dictionary words, and character diversity to ensure that passwords are resistant to common hacking techniques.

2. **Secure Password Generation:**
   - Users can generate highly secure passwords on demand using the built-in password generator feature.
   - The password generator creates random strings of characters with customizable parameters such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
   - Generated passwords prioritize randomness and complexity, making them resilient against brute-force attacks and password guessing.
